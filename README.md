Hey there! 👋

I'm a person who decided to start an adventure with coding - currently dive into Python, and I'm taking on C. Beyond typical programming, I'm into projecting HTML/CSS/JS websites 💻

Beyond coding, I'm into radio, especially FM DX, and I like tinkering with Linux. 📻 🐧

Would have forgotten - my heart beats for Czechia. 🇨🇿

Hope you'll find something useful on my GitHub profile!
